### Modes

this plugin support only one mode and you don't need to set mode explicitly.
the default mode update/insert a document. so if a document has already existed in the collection, it will be updated. if not, it will be inserted into the collection as new document.

## About multi-valued

Embluk does not allow multi-column with same name in a record. so if you want to feed multiValued field, you need to split data first. see this config example.

A column 'category' have multi values delimited with '||'. (ex. 'Animation||Drama||War')

```yaml
filters:
- type: split
  delimiter: '||'
  keep_input: true
  target_key: category
out:
  type: solr
  host: localhost
  port: 8983
  collection: mytest
  bulkSize: 1000
  idColumnName: id
  multiValuedField:
    - category
```

After split data, record previews as following.
```
| id:string | title:string     | category:string |
|         1 | Toy Story (1995) |       Animation |
|         1 | Toy Story (1995) |      Children's |
|         1 | Toy Story (1995) |          Comedy |
```


Also note this plugin assume records are sorted by id column value. So even if you don't need to use split plugin, you need to sort record to feed multiValued field.

## Example

```yaml
out:
  type: solr
  host: localhost
  port: 8983
  collection: mytest
  bulkSize: 500
  idColumnName: id
  multiValuedField:
    - category
```


## Build

```
$ ./gradlew gem  # -t to watch change of files and rebuild continuously
```
